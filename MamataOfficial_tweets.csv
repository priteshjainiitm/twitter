i have addressed a letter to ji on the recent incidents of unfortunate deaths of young indians in us
two more shocking killings of indians in the us goi must take this up with the us govt on an urgent basis
আধারের নামে মানুষের গোপনীয়তা ক্ষুন্ন করা হচ্ছে। এটাতো এক্সটরশান কেন্দ্রের মনোভাব এত নেতিবাচক কেন সারা দেশে এর প্রতিবাদ হয় উচিত। ৩ ৩
গরিব খেটে খাওয়া মানুষ আমাদের প্রিয় শিশুদের তাদের অধিকার থেকে বঞ্চিত করা হচ্ছে কেন ২ ৩
এখন থেকে কি ০ ৫ বছরের শিশুরও আধার কার্ড লাগবে মিড ডে মিল ও আইসিডিএসের জন্যও আধার কার্ড অবিশ্বাস্য একশো দিনের কাজও বাদ যায়নি। ১ ৩
in the name of aadhaar privacy is being lost and there is extortion why is this govt so negative as a nation we must condemn this 3 3
instead of helping the poorest of the poor the downtrodden and our favourite children why are their rights being snatched away 2 3
now even infants 0 5 years need aadhar cards aadhaar card for mid day meals and icds shocking 100 days’ work also not spared 1 3
आधार के नाम पर गोपनीयता नष्ट की जा रही है। यह एक तरह की वसूली है। यह सरकार इतनी नकारात्मक क्यों है पूरे देश में इसका विरोध होना चाहिए। ३ ३
गरीबों को मदद करने के स्थान पर गरीब पिछड़े हुए लोग और हमारे प्यारे बच्चों से उनका हक क्यों छीना जा रहा है २ ३
अब क्या नवजात शिशु 0 5 वर्ष को भी आधार कार्ड चाहिए मिड डे मील icds के लिए भी आधार चाहिए अविश्वसनीय नरेगा को भी रिहाई नहीं मिली १ ३
