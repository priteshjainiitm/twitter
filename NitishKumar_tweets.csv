sharing the full text of my twitter interview with
thank you for the interview
i thought we are still dealing with issues of 2015
i am sorry to hear about this pls share details at office nitish@gmail com my office get in touch with you
mit 2 2 mahagathbandhan and i have said it time and again that with me as cm only the rule of law prevail
mit please do not trouble yourself with such predicament the mandate is going to be decisively in favour of 1 2
the interest of bihar
alok investmnents and industrialization in the state
alok 2 3 the years and further strengthen our efforts by proactively reaching out to all key stakeholders to encourage
alok we continue to build upon our industrial growth nearly 14 that has been above national average over 1 3
a friend of mine shared those lines with me since i liked them found them relevant i thought i should share it with you all
2 2 last time i would be courteous and would extend pleasantries and hear him out on whatever he has to say
first of all i don t meet tantrics very often but in a hypothetical situation if i were to meet him again as i did 1 2
2 2 as seen in the last 3 phases of bihar elections clearly suggests that bihar s youth is in full support of mahagathbandhan
this is the impression that some have been trying to make the overwhelming support that mahagathbandhan has been getting 1 2
3 3 support for me and the mahagathbandhan
2 3 yes it is true that in these polls too they are voting in large numbers and i continue to believe in their overwhelming
it has been my privilege to have the trust and support of our women electorate throughout my political career 1 3
2 2 many occasions beef has never been an issue in bihar so any such attempt was bound to fail which is exactly what happened
no it s true that bjp did try to use the beef issue to add communal color to this election however as i ve said this on 1 2
when there was no such caign where is the question of partnering with anyone
not at all i would like to believe that people like me for all that i bring to the table including my allies
3 3 attempted to add communal colour to the bihar elections
2 3 out in the open for all to see not only the local leaders but also the national leaders including modiji himself have
during the course of this caign bjp‚Äôs repeated and blatant attempts to add communal colour to the debate have been 1 3
3 3 is nothing but one more attempt in the same direction
2 3 issues such as that of beef which have no relevance in bihar also in the last leg he is commenting on reservations which
modiji and his party has made brazen attempts to add communal colour to their caign in bihar they have tried to import 1 3
it‚Äôs a welcome trend and only adds to our confidence that mahagathbandhan is heading for a landslide victory
with people s blessings mahagathbandhan is all set for a landslide victory
2 2 my reading is that the mahagathbandhan is heading for a landslide victory
all indications suggest that people have decided to bless and support the mahagathbandhan 1 2
3 3 7 nishchays my seven point agenda to ensure unabated development of bihar
2 3 they have witnessed and on the basis of the priorities that i have outlined for the next 5 years in the form of my
there is no need for me to be any different people would elect me to office based on the work i have done so far which 1 3
3 3 is not in keeping with the dignity of the office he holds
2 3 modiji and his party who have lowered the standard of the debate and on many counts modiji himself has used language that
i stand for use of civil language in political discourse however i must say that during these elections in bihar it is 1 3
2 2 of the day beyond these in taking such decisions i have always tried to keep the interest of bihar above anything else
in choosing political partners or allies we have been guided primarily by principles ideology and the political realities 1 2

the saga continues so let us brace ourselves for a repeat performance in bihar
no words on promises he made then conveniently forgot black money farmer msp youth employment special status for bihar lists goes on
no words on gruesome killing of dalit children in haryana mob lynching in dadri or skyrocketing prices of dal 3 3
speak a word on issues that exhort the collective conscience of the country or bother the common masses 2 3
for someone who doesn‚Äôt miss an opportunity to talk or tweet by the minute on literally anything it is baffling that modiji doesn‚Äôt 1 3
modiji was always unmatched in theatrics rhetoric using unsubstantiated facts now tactical silence is his new weapon of choice
1sttime in history of electioneering in bihar women volunteers do door2door caign using specially designed cycles
over 100 hours modiji hasn‚Äôt uttered a word on dalit killings in haryana ‚Äì yet him invoking gandhiji‚Äôs ideals is nothing but preposterous
starting today i be sharing my thoughts on facebook here are some ‚Äòpoints to ponder‚Äô

sharing the prices of dal across states which suggests that the problem is not state specific but rather national
as dal prices soar instead of responding to the situation created by their own inaction incompetence goi shamelessly tries to blame states

we have all seen what he has done on lalitgate vyapam but when was the last time modiji practiced what he preached
he‚Äôs preaching about corruption and probity in public life but as on all other counts here too his actions don‚Äôt match his words
rattled by imminent defeat in bihar modiji forced to muster courage talk of corruption that wasn‚Äôt in his discourse since lalitgate vyapam
sharing a few pictures of our caign today
why talk about meat export when we are talking of meat production in gujarat that went up by 225 1 2
plz check your facts i‚Äôm using same report that modiji himself has quoted throughout his ls caign

thank you
communal issues to benefit stand defeated
we are moving ahead on our agenda results prove that those who are trying to use such cont
left behind in the development journey the present system is the best option
i believe in the present socio economic context to empower those who have been cont
after years of thinking debate and deliberations the present system of reservations has been put together cont
of course any day what is happening in maharashtra is deplorable and shows true colours of modiji and the bjp
bihar needs to win i assure you the impact be felt nationally
forget rift there is not even a wrinkle
and nda are just continuing on the same lines
prime minister himself has lowered the dignity of the debate and his colleagues in bjp cont
i always believe in use of decent language in political discourse however it is for everyone to see how the cont
the idea of deveopment with justice and has only one agenda that bihar continues on development journey
the alliance is the political reality i have repeated many times that mahagathbandhan is guided by cont
there is no tie up
of bihar are intelligent enough to see their design and discard it
i repeat it is not an issue in bihar bjp is trying hard to make this an issue but people cont
either he and his party should nominate a cm candidate for bihar who i d be happy to debate or he should be ready to debate himself
i am forced to dare him for a debate because he s trying to take the additional charge as cm of bihar as well logic is simple cont
no i believe in learnings not regrets
right now the job at hand is to win bihar and give best possible governance to the people of bihar amis
surveys and their accuracy and authenticity are best left to be analysed by journalists and commentators
and abbreviations every day without any substance and content
not worthy of any comment the nation is becoming used to gimmickry of modiji where he coins new terms cont
let s wait till november the 8th you wouldn t have to worry about such scenarios and probabilities
he still finds the time to watch soap operas and reality tv shows
amazing with all his foreign trips controlling all ministries playing proxy cm for many states being the only voice in the party
simple vote for magathbandhan
to the best of my knowledge he has already clarified on the issue in a statement made thereafter he has said cont
treats their colleagues and allies it adds to my conviction that i took the right decision
not for a single moment rather what i see of the govt in the last 15 months the way the present bjp leadership cont
laluji has not said what bjp is trying to attribute to him
to the elections in bihar i have not seen lalu ji s exact statement but from whatever i know of the incident cont
it is not an issue facing imminent defeat bjp is desperate at the last moment and trying to add communal texture
that suggests that we aren t working in complete harmony suri
absolutely since the time mahagathbandhan has been announced there has not been a single incident suri cont
then rather than using the president s statement as an alibi he would ve unequivocally condemned the issue spoken clearly on it 2 2
it is not adequate because he is not responding to the incident directly if he has a clear conscience 1 2
it is not a question of necessity in the present context the real political challenge in bihar and beyond is to defeat bjp
nation is grateful to the president that he has done his constitutional duty by being the conscious keeper of the nation
he should show courage and speak directly to the people of the country and condemn the incident in unequivocal terms cont
from all quarters he s trying to hide behind the president s statements people have electted him as the prime minister cont
more than 10 days of this gruesome incident and his silence on this deplorable incident has been deafening now under pressure 1 2
here are the details for your reference
it‚Äôs audacious how modiji talks big on regional development in munger while his govt wants to scrap scra scheme inspite of my requests
all to see why vajpayee ji was forced to remind him to follow raj dharma but wonder who do the vajpayee today 2 2

a developed bihar among the top states in india leading the country on all key development parameters
law take its course
uvaach but i am sure with increasing industrialisation this would change in the coming years
uvaach bihar s economy is still predominantly agrarian which means there is little scope for people outside the state to come work
uvaach part of it is because historically people from bihar have been going to many parts of india to work including gujarat cont
no my parting ways with bjp was driven by ideology and principles which would ve come in question had i continued with them
in last 10 years the progress on both handling floods as well as construction of roads is there for everyone to see 2 2
my vision for bihar which includes north bihar to put the state among the most developed states of india 1 2

bihar sets an exle a landmark bill on grievance redressal
condolences to those who lost their near and dear in the train mishap have instructed officials to provided all possible help to the victims
we have moved on
don t you think such comment on the elected cm of the state made by the pm could hurt many is completely undesirable
it only get better in years to come 2 2
overall industrial growth in the last 10 years has been an average of 13 3 compared to national average of 6 9 1 2
the alliance has already declared its cm candidate
idea of public engagement outreach could appear similar but the thought vision and tools employed are in stark difference
we are confident of securing big win in bihar however in democracy support of all sections individuals is always welcome
but i came back to office so that development of bihar doesn t take a backseat 2 2
i resigned on moral grounds taking responsibility of defeat of party in general elections 1 2
this is factually incorrect law and order situation in bihar is one of the best in the country
i do not agree with your assessment there is no question of any regret
you think bjp which has ljp manjhi others as alliance partner has any locus to comment on propriety of any political alliance
there is no question of any personal dislike whatever differences we have are ideological
thank you for the overwhelming response there are more than 500 questions will try to respond to them in the next few days
i have said nothing it is all speculative
don t worry the future of bihar is safe
any way special status is not linked to the allocations of the finance commission 2 2
this is factually incorrect the fact is share of bihar has been reduced by the 14th finance commission 1 2
so are we to believe he did so
if the pm is so concerned why is he now not declaring him as the cm candidate of nda 2 2
i selected him as my colleague not because of his caste 1 2
i am sharing the report card for you and everyone to see
the facts figures don t support your statement as our performance improved during the second term and has been eventful
no it was in reference to my past association with bjp
don t worry my image is not fragile
if it was such a big issue why did they contest 2010 elections under my leadership after that episode 2 2
i have reiterated time and again that the dinner was cancelled by them and not by me and 1 2
it is his call
i am always open to learn new things
in my view the comment was made because i represent the people of bihar against whom they have a prejudice 2 2
i am son of bihar so biologically my dna is similar to that of people of bihar 1 2
my sentiments are reflected in my letter it is for the people to judge
irrespective of which party he belongs to he is indeed the pride of bihar
his removal was a collective party decision 2 2
i take the responsibility of making him the cm for which i have publicly apologised 1 2
this election is a referendum on my policies and my track record as a cm there is no clash if any it is of ideologies
a retraction if it doesn t happen i leave the judgement to the people
this election is a referendum on my policies and the track record
i don t see any problem in the alliance it s a political process and it is no different from any other alliance
gadkari caste is the reality of indian society and bihar is no different from any other state
in the middle of answering your questions on twitter
it is not an election issue for me it is a question of bihari asmita
i thought this is the right time to request him to withdraw his words 2 2
