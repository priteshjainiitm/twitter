heartiest congratulations to people of telangana your struggle has borne fruit
thank you but is that the editor s take
if all that we did was not vociferous that is for you to decide
the answer is very clear the bill had to be referred to standing committee because of bjps opposition
be referred to the standing committee
if all parties had agreed to pass the bill as claimed by government why was the bill not passed and had to
my simple question is the bill was introduced in rajya sabha on 30th aug and rs was in session till 7th sep
your comments on editors take are unfair
this‘aide memoire’ leaked by government to the media is a case of dishonest and mischievous reporting
there was discussion on two bills what i said in favour of the first bill was clubbed with the second bill that we opposed
after going through this document i must say that what is attributed to me in the all party meeting is completely false
cnn ibn has shown me a document titled aide memoire which government has leaked to media these r not minutes of all party meeting
exactly
minutes what minutes minutes were never circulated to us
the fact is that bjp opposed the bill that is why the bill was referred to standing committee
check why the bill was referred to standing committee while the law minister was hell bent to pass the bill
check if the bill ever came to lok sabha no never
we opposed the bill we opposed the ordinance what cong is spreading since morning is complete falsehood
we said the ordinance was immoral illegal and unconstitutional
and when the ordinance was promulgated we voiced our opposition on day one and requested the president not to sign the ordinance
it was because of our opposition that the bill was referred to the standing committee
we told kapil sibal that the bill was wrong and unconstitutional
after bill was introduced in rajya sabha kapil sibal met arun and me in my chamber and we made our opposition very categoric and clear
chidambaram and kamal nath both told me that we should send all four options to standing committee for thorough deliberation
in the all party meeting four choices were placed before us there were divergent views and no consensus could emerge aftwr the meeting
referred to standing committee by rajya sabha itself
bill in any forum including lok sabha for his information the bill never came to lok sabha it was introduced in rajya sabha and

arnab pl note we are opposed to the contents of this ordinance that is why we called it unconstitutional
we are against the contents of the ordinance that is the reason we said it is unconstitutional
we are meeting rashtrapatiji tomorrow the 26th september at 5 30 pm against ordinance for convicted mps

my speech in the budget session of parliament
the government should not be stubborn
we are opposed to the ordinance route for such an important legislation

under the constitution an ordinance can be promulgated only under extraordinary situations

however the better option be to prepone the monsoon session which is anyway due in july
we are not opposed to a special session of parliament
the ordinance route for such an important legislation is not desirable

nothing short of death sentence in cases of rape of children and cases involving brutality and barbarity help
in cases of rape of children and cases involving brutality and barbarity as in the present case
home minister should convene a meeting of representatives of all political parties to provide for death sentence
these perverts and sadists require shock treatment we need to make the recent law more stringent

yes i be caigning in gujarat for many days starting from 1st december
yes we be firm on a discussion under rule 184
no confidence motion if no confidence motion is negatived the government wins and the issue is lost
there is broader opposition unity on the specific issue of fdi in multi brand retail some parties are not in favour of
we cannot do that on our own we have given notice under rule 184 motion has to be admitted before a discussion
that is called the arrogance of power
that is the reason why we are pressing for a discussion under rule 184
this is possible only under a motion which is followed by a vote
now we are left with no choice other than expressing our opinion in the house
the government violated this assurance and has unilaterally announced the decision to implement fdi in multi brand retail
be taken after a consensus is developed through the process of consultation with political parties and chief ministers of states
on 7th december 2011 the then finance minister categorically assured the house that the decision to implement the fdi in multi brand retail
the discussion under rule 184 is followed by a vote whereas discussion under rule 193 does not express the opinion of the house
there are some questions as to why we are pressing for a discussion under r 184 i explain
